Motivation:

In our fast-paced modern lives, a sense of social isolation has become increasingly relevant to people from all walks of life. The advancement of technology and the prevalence of social media paradoxically have made it more challenging for individuals to form genuine connections and expand their social circles. This struggle is particularly true for university students, including those at the National University of Singapore (NUS), who often face the pressures of academic demands and the transition to a new environment. Recognizing this issue, the creation of a safe and trusted social platform or app specifically tailored for NUS students can play a crucial role in addressing social isolation and fostering meaningful connections.

Our proposed social platform/app aims to bridge the gap between students, allowing them to connect with one another and engage in various shared activities. By focusing on matching individuals with similar interests, our platform provides a space for users to have a fun time and potentially form long-lasting friendships with like-minded peers. Through this platform, NUS students will have the opportunity to expand their social networks, discover new hobbies, and engage in meaningful conversations.

Moving away from NUS students, our socialising platform/app can further serve as a valuable resource for incoming freshmens or exchange students. It can facilitate the integration of students into the university community, enabling them to meet people from various backgrounds and forge connections based on shared interests. This can be particularly beneficial for international students who may face additional challenges in adapting to a new culture and making friends.

In conclusion, the development of our proposed platform for NUS students has the potential to address the prevalent issue of social isolation and enhance the social lives of university students. By leveraging technology and emphasising the importance of shared interests, our platform can facilitate connections among NUS students, leading to the creation of new friendships and a sense of community. As we navigate the challenges of our fast-paced modern lives, fostering genuine connections and meaningful relationships remains crucial, and we believe our platform can play a significant role in achieving that goal.
